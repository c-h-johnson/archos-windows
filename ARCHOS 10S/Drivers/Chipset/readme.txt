* 4.  LIST OF AVAILABLE COMMAND LINE FLAG OPTIONS
************************************************************
The Intel(R) Chipset Device Software supports several 
command line flags for various installation options. 

Below is a list of all the available command line flags that
may be used with the program call.  Note that the '-L' and 
the '-S' flags MUST be specified at the end of the command 
line flag list.

Flag        Description
----            -----------
-?              
                Displays the list of available command line 
                flags. This flag works in Interactive Mode only.  

-A              
                Extracts the INF files and Readme to either 
                "C:\Program Files\Intel\InfInst" or the
                <Installation Path> directory specified using 
                the '-P' flag. The software will NOT install 
                these INF files to the system. This flag can 
                be combined only with the '-P' flag. All other
                options will be ignored if the '-A' flag is 
                specified. This flag works in Interactive Mode
                only.

-AONLY          
                Extracts the needed INF files to install on the
                current system. If the install has been run once
                successfully, '-AONLY' will not return any INFs
                when used in conjunction with '-OVERALL' switch, 
                all the needed INFs for the system will be 
                extracted.		

-B              
                Automatically reboots the system after 
                installation. This flag is ignored if '-A' flag
                is specified. This flag works in either Silent 
                Mode or Interactive Mode.

-F2 <path\filename>             
                Specifies an alternate location and name 
                of the log file created by InstallShield Silent.
                This option is used for silent installation from
                a CD. 'Path' indicates the directory path where
                installation status is logged in file 'filename'.

-L <number>    
                Specifies the language of the setup dialogs. 
                This flag works in Interactive Mode only.

-NOLIC          
                Does not display the license agreement dialog box during
                installation. This parameter works in Interactive
                Mode only.

-NOREAD         
                Does not display the Readme display during installation. 
                This flag works in Interactive Mode only.

-NOWEL          
                Does not display the welcome screen during installation. 
                This flag works in Interactive Mode only.

-OVERALL       
                Updates ALL INF drivers on all available devices
                even if third party drivers are currently installed. 
                This flag works in Interactive Mode only.

-OVERIDE	
                Updates the storage drivers even if a third
                party storage driver is currently installed. 
                This flag works in Interactive Mode only.

-OVERWRITE       
                Ignores the overwrite warning dialog when 
                installing an older version of the software.

-P<Installation Path>   
                Specifies the hard disk location to which the 
                INF program files are copied. If this flag is 
                not specified at the command line, the 
                <Installation Path> directory is as follows: 
                
                   C:\Program Files\Intel\INFInst
                
               	If this flag is used without the '-A' option, 
               	only the Readme will be copied to 
               	<Installation Path>. The directory name can 
               	include spaces, but then a pair of double quotes 
               	(") must enclose the directory name. There should
                not be any space between the switch '-p' and the 
                directory name. This flag works in either Silent 
                Mode or Interactive Mode.

-S              
                Runs the Installer in Silent Mode (no user 
                interface is displayed). This flag and the
                '-L' flag must be placed at the end of the 
                command line flag list.
                
Below are the language codes used with the '-L' flag:

************************************************************
* 5.  CONTENTS OF THE EXTRACTED FILES
************************************************************
INF files are copied to the hard disk after running the 
Intel(R) Chipset Device Software executable with an '-A' 
flag (i.e., "INFINST_AUTOL.EXE -A" or "SETUP.EXE -A"). 
The location of the INF files depends on whether a '-P' 
flag is specified along with the '-A' flag:

1.  If a '-P' flag is not specified, then the INF files are 
    copied to the following directory:  
    
            "C:\Program Files\Intel\INFINST"
    
2.  If a '-P' flag is specified, then the INF files are copied 
    to the location listed immediately after the '-P' flag.  

    Refer to Section 4 for more information on flag usage.

After INF file extraction, the INF files and components are 
copied to the <INF Extract Directory>. These files and 
components are categorized according to the operating system. 
The following table summarizes the locations of the 
INF files by operating system:

   NOTE: 
            "<INF Extract Directory>" is abbreviated "<IED>" in 
            the remainder of this section.

The directories are classified according to the following:

   All\   
            Contains INF files designed for
            Windows* 2000, Windows* XP, and Windows Server* 2003.
            
   Vista\   
            Contains INF files designed for Windows* Vista ONLY.

   NOTE: 
            INFAnswr.TXT makes a CUSTOM.INF template that installs 
            the INF files for Intel(R) chipsets during operating
            system setup. OEMs can incorporate this file into the 
            Setup directory for the OEM Preload Kit. 
            (Refer to Section 8 for more details.)

* 11.  TROUBLESHOOTING
************************************************************
It is assumed that the system requirements in Section 2 above 
have been satisfied.

Issue:	    
            USB devices no longer work correctly after you 
            install the Intel Chipset Software Installation 
            Utility in Windows XP or in Windows Server 2003.

Solution:  
            A recommended fix has been provided by Microsoft
            in Knowledge Base article(921411). For additional 
            information, please refer to the KB article located 
            at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/921411/en-us
            
            Please use the following installation procedures: 
                - Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 installed
                - QFE (921411) installed
                - Latest Intel(R) Chipset Device Software

Issue:	    
            At the end of executing the Chipset Device Software,
        		the USB keyboard and mouse will stop functioning. 
        		This problem only occurs when using Windows XP with 
        		SP1 or Windows 2000 Server with SP4 on a system 
        		configured with a USB keyboard and/or mouse. This 
        		condition is temporary until a system reset.

Solution:  
            A recommended fix has been provided by Microsoft
            in Knowledge Base article(822603). For additional 
            information, please refer to the KB article located at
            http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;[LN];822603  

            Please use the following installation procedures: 
                - Windows XP installed with SP1
                - QFE (822603) installed

Issue:      
            System locks up during Device Manager Remove or 
            during restart.

Solution:   
            System lockup can occur during reboot as a 
            result of several possible system issues.  In 
            the event of system lockup, reboot the machine 
            and view Device Manager.  If devices are listed 
            properly and the system experiences no further 
            problems, then the .INF file restore process was 
            successful. If devices are not configured 
            correctly, try re-running the procedures 
            outlined in Section 3.

            If this does not fix the issue or further issues
            are experienced, reinstall the operating system.

Issue:      
            After running the setup program and rebooting 
            the machine, Windows reports that it cannot find 
            one of the following files: ESDI_506.pdr

Solution:   
            Click Browse in the dialog box where this issue
            occurs, locate the <Windows>\System\IOSubsys
            directory. Click OK. The system should be able to
            locate this file in this directory and continue 
            re-enumerating for the new devices.

Issue:      
            After running the setup program and rebooting 
            the machine, Windows reports that it cannot find 
            one of the following files:
 
                  UHCD.SYS
                  USBD.SYS
                  USBHUB.SYS

Solution:   
            Click Browse in the dialog box where this issue 
            occurs and locate the following directory:
			
                  <Winnt>\System32\drivers 
                  
            Click OK. The system should be able to locate the 
            files in this directory and continue re-enumerating 
            for the new devices.

Issue:      
            After running the setup program and rebooting 
            the machine, Windows reports that it cannot find 
            the following file: ISAPNP.VXD

Solution:   
            Click Browse in the dialog box where this issue 
            occurs and locate the <Winnt>\System directory. 
            Click OK. The system should be able to locate this 
            file in this directory and continue re-enumerating 
            for the new devices.

Issue:      
            After performing the silent install, the 
            HKLM\Software\Intel\InfInst key was not created 
            or the data of the value "install" is not 
            "success".

Solution:   
            This is caused by one of the following 
            scenarios:
               - The current system does not contain a 
                 supported operating system, or
                 -or-
               - The current system does not contain a 
                 supported chipset.

            Verify that the System Requirements are met as 
            outlined in Section 2.
